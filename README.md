# Responsive pages solution
<h1>Learning Project</h1>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This is just a simple layout component that I created from <a href="https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts">Kevin Powells Course on Css responsiveness.</a></p>
<p>Now there is still a lot missing like media queries and making a couple things more responsive, but the goal was really to get better at using Flexbox. I also learnt a lot about wrapping elements in different containers to achieve different results.</p>

<h2>What I struggled on</h2>
<p>The struggle on this one was real. I had to question my skill level. After a failed attempt I went back to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and came back even stronger</p>
<p>I struggled a lot with alignments and making everything fit correctly.</p>
<p>My use of flexbox is... questionable.</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>Through all the struggle of course comes growth.</p>
<p>I learnt a lot and I even got better at using flexbox</p>
<p>I played around with variables and a lot of other stuff.</p>
<p>Whilst creating this I went down a rabbit hole of cool css and html tricks.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>With all that said, there's still A LOT to improve on. I'm nowhere close to being good at this but I believe I will be, I'm ready to learn from any advice I can gain on this.</p>
<p>Every mistake is a learning oppurtunity and so is every new task. I'm looking for some real deal criticism, challenges, resources, etc.</p>
